  <h2 class="heading main">why am i here</h2>
    <p class="blurb main">i have been trying to build a website
  using a website builder. try as i might,
  i cannot figure out how to get the look that i want.
  <br>
  i am learning to code to put this process back into my own hands and
  build exactly what i have inside my head and to have the ability
  to change it as often as it changes in my mind.
